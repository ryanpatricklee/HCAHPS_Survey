# SQL: HCAHPS Survey
The Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) is a patient satisfaction survey that most hospitals are required to submit to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The survey asks patients questions like:
- Was the hospital always quiet and clean at night?
- Did the nurses and doctors treat you with respect?
- Did you receive call button help as soon as possible?
- Did you understand your discharge instructions?

Patients are asked to rate how often these things happened with "Usually", "Sometimes or Never", or "Always". The "Always" wording is what we aim for, and is called a **Top Box** answer.
